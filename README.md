## Riot Layout

Simple Riot Layout Manager for Meteor with SSR Support.

With Riot Layout you can easily render riot components both alike in client and server. In the server it uses Flow Router's upcoming SSR apis.

### Adding it to your project

~~~
meteor add baysao:riot-layout
~~~

Then you use `RiotLayout.render()` to render your component.
